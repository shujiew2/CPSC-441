## Solve: 
## 2x+5y = 33
## x+3y = 19

```{r}
x<-matrix(c(2,5,1,3),2,2,T) #make matrices of the coefficients
y<-matrix(c(33,19),2,1,T)
Solution<-solve(x,y) #solve for the answers
Solution
```
x=4,y=5

## Create a vector 1:100 and calculates the mean

```{r}
Vector<-c(1:100) #create the vector
Sum<-sum(Vector) #sum up all the values in the vector
Divider<-length(Vector) #the number of values in the vector
Mean<-Sum/Divider #solve for the average by dividing the total by the number of values
Mean
```

## Data Frame

```{r}
m<-matrix(c("A","B","C","D","D","E","F","G"), nrow=2, ncol=4, byrow=T) #make the matrix
as.data.frame(m) #transform the matrix in to a dataframe
